# DeFI-corp
working on  implementing real life applciations of present DeFI protocol using the web3 and present open  source projects .  here  me and Bertrand will work on  putting together the ideas in our discussion and then implement basic MVP's for each of them.


Proposal and some insights that we got from our meeting on  10th april. 

 **Creating the future of DLT  based  sustainable enterprises. and participating in hackathons**  

**AIM**

- [ ]  to agree on the  implementation of some  structured way of  getting into  DLT  software creation  company ( either as consultants /  project implementation).
    - [ ]  Website creation ( i have some good single page tamplates that we can implement)
    - [ ]  medium blog post of the ideas
    - [ ]  creating a cloud account and  "hack our way out for creating practical  web3.0 organisations".
- [ ]  working on the following hackathons / organisations :
    - [ ]  Gitcoin : taking initially simple gigs and getting reputation score .
    - [ ]  [Blockchain  Hackathon lists](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon-list)
    - [ ]  another prominent community :  [ethglobal](https://www.ethglobal.co/) . [https://defirate.com/](https://defirate.com/) .
    - [ ]  and then  comparing our solutions  / giving our views on  the current financial  news  ( Bloomberg / economic .

## Introduction:

this happened on 10th april , discussing the possiblity of having a part-time collaboration on  making fintech projects  more focused on financial inclusion and creating SaaS on  following  possible themes :

1. Financial inclusion: Seeing the current financial infrastructure being  very questionable when coming in terms of disbursing the aid and  maintaining low transfer costs in the global forex is still taking time to realise ( specially for  third world countries ) thus  the company able to connect the  mall business owners and merchants ( being the bulk of manufacturing and other non metropole job holders )  to line of credits during the crisis and also for creating new oppertunities / jobs   will be the only way to get the higher taxing nations economy back on track . the main focus on keeping the compliance with the banks and companies as close as possible . this includes 
    - thus we will be having the middleware which will connect the bank accounts of enterprises ,  using PSD2 api providers  ( plaid ) which then can be connected to the respective  crypto exchanges ( with the easy mitigation of tax compliance , KYC and other steps to be done automatically). following link gives the example of integration :

        [Plaid Demo | Plaid](https://plaid.com/demo/?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTlRabVl6QTVZemxoWkRneSIsInQiOiJcL3RsbTZYSlwvVXlCK2Rpb1Z4cVltZm5DT3hPKzVWeFZiS2gxWXlVRG5BRDR6RTVcL09VWTZsVFQ2dFo4b2RyRFRReHpLdmVlakdNeGZXdEJYUHV1VW5FMFhZcEFhWGdtOFcxaUE2TUZEWVl3Zm1cL01WUmRQSXdTWHMxaEpKWVNGUnkifQ%3D%3D&countryCode=FR&language=en&product=transactions)

    - then after getting currency , the virtual secure wallet can be connected to the diffrent pools of the DeFI 2nd layer protocols ( AAVE , compound , dYdX and dharma currently for their  compliance ,  then the investments can be routed  back to the fiat  in bulk transactions.

thus our main intrest is either : gathering 

1. My queries : - working on finalising the base of the architecture :
    - for automated swaps and getting them  integrated directly with bank account can also be done via [ramp.network](http://ramp.network) . this will be instant and  less fees ( but for more compliance , plaid is more suitable ).
    - For secure wallet : portis account to be created  for creating the  wallets ( or ledger for more security ) also creating the parallel interface of money and crypto assets for the people to be more accostmed to the robinhood app kind of investment of money : [https://github.com/robinhood](https://github.com/robinhood).

- My own thoughts : for more ambtious thoughts in  trading markets in US forex or other ETF's , using ISDA CDM models to create complex futures and other contracts can be a possiblity if our present solution works .

3. [Nuo Crypto trading service](https://www.nuo.network/) : this is somewhat our competitior bt we have much bigger sights , our main focus is the inclusion of the middle class and other  business to take care of their loans and other insurances .  

4. some awesome links for blog s for implementation  of our solution :

**6 .**    Some innovative ideas  being pursued in the hackathons for creating synthetic assets to understand the architecture of the systems : Synthetix ,  DeFISilver  , Blazar  and DefiZAP protocol. 




on 10th may : the main projects being considered for the work to be progressed : aave risk framework , fuse.io  , rcmpi-wallet and
